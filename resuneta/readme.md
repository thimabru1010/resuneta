# ResUNet-a: a deep learning framework for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed data

This repository contains source code for some of the models used in the manuscript of the ([ResUNet-a](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00592)) paper. ResUNet-a is built with the [mxnet](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/) DL framework, under the gluon api.

### Requirements
1. mxnet (latest version, tests run with mxnet_cu92-1.5.0b20190613)
2. opencv
3. rasterio
4. glob
5. pathos
6. [ISPRS Potsdam data](http://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm3/wg4/2d-sem-label-potsdam.html) that should be appropriately preprocessed (slices of 256x256 patches). 



### Directory Structure

Complete models live in the ```models``` directory, specifically models d6 and d7 (conditioned multitasking). 
These are built from modules that are alive in ```resuneta/nn``` directory. The Tanimoto loss function (with complement) is defined in file ```resuneta/nn/loss/loss.py```  Inference demo (```.ipynb```) can be found in directory demo. Directory ```nn``` contains all necessary modules for building resuneta models. Directort ```src``` is related to dataset definitions. In addition, file src/chopchop_run.py is an executable that produces slices of patches in size 256x256 from the original data. Please see the source code for modifications based on your directory structures.

### Example of model usage 
See also ```demo/*.ipynb```

```python
In [1]: from resuneta.models.resunet_d7_causal_mtskcolor_ddist import *
   ...: from mxnet import nd
   ...: 

In [2]: Nfilters_init = 32
   ...: NClasses = 6
   ...: net = ResUNet_d7(Nfilters_init,NClasses)
   ...: net.initialize()
   ...: 
depth:= 0, nfilters: 32
depth:= 1, nfilters: 64
depth:= 2, nfilters: 128
depth:= 3, nfilters: 256
depth:= 4, nfilters: 512
depth:= 5, nfilters: 1024
depth:= 6, nfilters: 2048
depth:= 7, nfilters: 1024
depth:= 8, nfilters: 512
depth:= 9, nfilters: 256
depth:= 10, nfilters: 128
depth:= 11, nfilters: 64
depth:= 12, nfilters: 32

In [3]: xx = nd.random.uniform(shape=[1,5,256,256]) 

In [4]: out = net(xx)
```
